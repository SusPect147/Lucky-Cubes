## 🚀 **How the Game Works**

The core gameplay is as clean as it gets: tap the cube, watch it roll, enjoy the rewards. Beneath that simplicity sits a smooth progression system that constantly gives you something to look forward to.

### 🏅 **XP & Level Progression**

Every roll grants you **Experience Points (XP)**.  
As your XP grows, you rise through ranks — from humble *Roller Newbie* to the divine **Dice Deity** and beyond.

Leveling up also unlocks new visual elements, cube skins, and other cosmetic perks that make your progress feel tangible and fun.

### 💰 **Game Economy**

Each roll also rewards you with **Coins**, the main in-game currency.  
Coins will eventually be used for customization, upgrades, and special items that let you flex your style or optimize your progress.

### 🎯 **Quests**

To keep things spicy, the game includes a Quest system with both daily and long-term goals. Completing them grants bonus XP and Coins.

Expect quests like:
- Roll the cube a certain number of times  
- Trigger Rainbow Mode several times  
- Reach specific level milestones  

Quests help give structure to your play sessions while rewarding consistent progress.

### 🌈 **Rainbow Mode**

Every once in a while, you’ll trigger the rare **Rainbow Mode** — a flashy, exciting moment where all XP gains get multiplied for a short streak of rolls.  
If you’re lucky enough to hit this mode, your progress skyrockets. It’s your chance to break through multiple levels in minutes.
